## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties

### What I learned

I used to basic knowledge I've acquired to complete this project. I had a little difficulty in positioning my card responsively but did my best. Also came across a little problem properly positioning the image within the card.
I'm open to correction and will continue learning more on proper positioning.


```css
/* Main Container */
.container{
    width: 250px;
    height: 400px;
    background: var(--box);
    position: absolute;
    top: 20%;
    left: 40%;
    border-radius: 10px
}

/* Image */
.image{
width: 250px;
height: 250px;
padding: 13px;
align-items: center;
align-content: center;
border-radius: 20px;
}

```

### Continued development

I would definitely be looking to improve my knowledge on positioning and nesting of divs. Also look into working with images properly/ 

### Useful resources

- [ W3schools](https://www.w3schools.com) - This has been my guide since i started learning and it helped me understand positioning concepts which I used.
